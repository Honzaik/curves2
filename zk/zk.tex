\textbf{Lemma Q.1.} \textit{Proof:}

Denote $h = x_2^2 - f(x_1)$ and assume $h = u \cdot v$ where $u, v \in \bar{K}[x_1,x_2]$. 

First assume $u,v \in \bar{K}[x_1,x_2] \setminus \bar{K}[x_1]$ i.e. $\deg_{x_2}(u) > 0, \deg_{x_2}(v) > 0$. Because $\deg_{x_2}(u) + \deg_{x_2}(v) = \deg_{x_2}(h) = 2 \implies \deg_{x_2}(u) = 1 = \deg_{x_2}(v)$. W.l.o.g assume $lc_{x_2}(u)=1=lc_{x_2}(v)$, we can do that since $lc_{x_2}(h)=1$. Therefore we can write $u = x_2 - s_1$ and $v = x_2 - s_2$ where $s_1, s_2 \in \bar{K}[x_1]$. This gives us
\[
x_2^2 - f(x_1) =h = (x_2 - s_1)(x_2 - s_2) = x_2^2 - (s_1+s_2)x_2 + s_1 s_2
\]
So it must hold that $s_1 = -s_2$ and then $h = x_2^2 + s_1(-s_1) \implies f(x_1) = s_1^2$. 

Now assume w.l.o.g $u \in \bar{K}[x_1]$.We compare the leading coefficients.
\[
1 = lc_{x_2}(h) = lc_{x_2}(u) \cdot lc_{x_2}(v) = u \cdot lc_{x_2}(v)
\]
This shows that $u$ must be invertible in $\bar{K}[x_1,x_2] \implies u \in \bar{K}^*$. In other words $h$ is absolutely irreducible.

\textbf{Sublemma Q.3.5} \textit{Let $F/K$ be an algebraic function field, $char(K) \neq 2$, that is given by $y^2 = f(x)$, $f$ being a quaternary polynomial that posseses a simple root. Let $P \in \mathbb{P}_{F/K}$. If $x \notin P$ or $y \notin P$, then $x,y \notin P$ and $2v_P(x)=v_P(y)$}.

\textit{Proof:}
In $F$ it holds $y^2 = f(x)$ by definition which implies that for every $P \in \mathbb{P}_{F/K}$ $v_P(y^2) = 2v_P(y)=v_P(f(x))$.

Assume $v_P(x) < 0 \leq v_P(y)$. By properties of valution we have $\deg(f)v_P(x) = v_P(f(x)) = 2v_P(y) \implies 2v_P(x)=v_P(y)$ and by assumption $v_P(y) > v_P(x) \implies 2v_P(x) > v_P(x) \iff v_P(x) > 0$. That's a contradiction.

Now assume $v_P(x) \geq 0 > v_P(y)$. $v_P(x) \geq 0 \implies v_P(f(x)) \geq 0$ then $0 \leq v_P(f(x)) = 2v_P(y) < 0$ which is again a contradiction.

We have proven $v_P(x) < 0 \iff v_P(y) < 0$. Therefore we have the equality $4v_P(x) = 2v_P(y) \iff 2v_P(x) = v_P(y)$ assuming $v_P(x) < 0$ or $v_P(y) < 0$. 

$\qed$

\textbf{Lemma Q.4.} \textit{Proof:}
By sublemma Q.3.5 we know, that if $P \in \mathbb{P}_{F/K}: x^{-1} \in P \implies y^{-1} \in P$ and $2v_P(x)=v_P(y)$. This proves $(y)_{-}=2(x)_{-}$ ($x^{-1},y^{-1}$ "share" places and the valuation is 2:1).

Let's first assume that $f$ possesses a multiple root. Therefore $f(x_1) = (x_1-\alpha)^2g(x_1)$ where $\deg(g) = 2$ and $g$ is not a square. By Q.3 $F$ is given by $z^2 = g(x)$ i.e. $F=K(x,z)$. $[F:K(x)]=2$ since $min_{z,K(x)}(T) = T^2 - g(x)$, that polynomial has $z$ as a root in $F$ and it is absolutely irreducible (as a polynomial in $K[x,T]$) since $g$ is not a square. We can then assume $\bar{K}=K$ since $[F:\bar{K}(x)] = 2$ (same polynomial) and $[F:K(x)] = [F:\bar{K}(x)][\bar{K}:K] = 2 \implies [\bar{K}:K] = 1$.

Then we know $\deg((x)_{-}) = [F:K(x^{-1})] = [F:K(x)] = 2$ i.e. $\deg(D)=2$.

Now assume $f$ is separable. We can then use the same argument for $K=\bar{K}$ since $min_{y,K(x)}(T) = T^2-f(x)$ and by Q.1 this one is also absolutely irreducible. $F=K(x,y) \implies [F:K(x)] = [F:\bar{K}(x)][\bar{K}:K] = 2 \implies [\bar{K}:K]=1$. And again $\deg(D)=2$.

Now let's prove that the genus is at most 1. Since $\deg(D)=2 \implies \sum\limits_{P: x^{-1}\in P} v_P(x)\deg(P) = 2$ means we have 2 possibilities (we are assuming $K=\bar{K}$ which implies $\forall P \in \mathbb{P}_{F/K}: \deg(P)=1$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item There exists a unique place $P_\infty: v_{P_\infty}(x)=-2, v_{P_\infty}(y)=-4$ and $D = 2P_\infty$
    \item There are 2 distinct places $P,Q$ s.t. $v_P(x)=-1=v_Q(x), v_P(y)=-2=v_Q(y)$ and $D = P + Q$.
\end{enumerate}

In both cases we can see that for $k \geq 2: \{1,x,\dots,x^k, y, yx, \dots, yx^{k-2}\} \subset \mathcal{L}(kD)$ because $(x^k) + kD = k((x)_{+}-(x)_{-})+k(x)_{-} = k(x)_{+} \geq 0$ and also $(y)_{-}=2(x)_{-}$ so it holds if we substitute $x^2$ for $y$. This subset is linearly indepent over $K$ because $y$ cannot be expressed as a linear combination of $x^i$ since $f$ has one simple root (if $f(x)=g^2(x) \implies y=g(x)$). The set also contains $2k$ elements. Therefore $l(kD) \geq 2k$. 

We know that for a sufficiently large $k$ (if $l(kD) \geq 2g-1$, $g$ genus) we have $l(kD) = \deg(kD)-g+1$ having $\deg(kD)=2k, l(kD) \geq 2k \implies 0 \leq l(kD)-\deg(kD) = -g + 1 \iff g \leq 1$.

$\qed$

\textbf{Proposition Q.5.} \textit{Proof:}
In the proof of lemma Q.4 we have established there are 2 possibilities for the structure of $(x)_{-}$ either $(x)_{-}=2P_\infty$ or $(x)_{-} = P + Q$, $P,Q$ distinct. 

$\qed$


\textbf{Theorem Q.6.} \textit{Proof:}
Assume genus 0. There exists $t \in F$ s.t. $(t)=P-Q$ and also $(t^{-1})=-(t)=Q-P$. Also $l(D)=\deg(D)+1 = 3$. 

$t \in \mathcal{L}(D)$ since $(t)+D = P-Q+P+Q=2P \geq 0$. Also $t^{-1} \in \mathcal{L}(D): (t^{-1})+D=Q-P+P+Q = 2Q \geq 0$. $t$ and $t^{-1}$ are linearly independent since $t \notin K$. This means $\{1,t,t^{-1}\}$ is a basis of $\mathcal{L}(D)$.

$x \in \mathcal{L}(D) \implies x = c_0+c_1t+c_2t^{-1}$ for some $c_i \in K$. This is equivalent to saying $tx = u(t), u(t) \in K[t], \deg(u)=2$.

In the same way we see $\{1,t,t^{-1},t^2,t^{-2}\}$ for a basis of $\mathcal{L}(2D)$. Again $y \in \mathcal{L}(2D): (y) + 2D = (y)_{+} - (y)_{-} + 2(x)_{-} = (y)_{+} \geq 0$. This means $t^2y = v(t)$ where $v(t) \in K[t], \deg(v)=4$.

$y^2 = f(x) \iff t^4y^2=t^4f(x)$. Substitute $yt=v(t)$ and $xt^2=u(t)$ then we have equality $v^2(t)=t^4f(\frac{u(t)}{t})$. $f$ is a polynomial of degree $4$ therefore it has up to $4$ different roots $1 \leq i \leq 4: \alpha_i \implies v^2(t)=t^4(\frac{u(t)}{t}-\alpha_1)(\frac{u(t)}{t}-\alpha_2)(\frac{u(t)}{t}-\alpha_3)(\frac{u(t)}{t}-\alpha_4)$ we can rewrite this as 
\begin{gather*}
v^2(t)=(u(t)-t\alpha_1)(u(t)-t\alpha_2)(u(t)-t\alpha_3)(u(t)-t\alpha_4)
\end{gather*}
$v^2(t)=v(t)v(t)$ is a polynomial of degree $8$, which has at most 4 different roots. Also $u(t)-t\alpha_i$ is a polynomial of degree 2. There exist at most two $\alpha \in K$ s.t. $u(t)-t\alpha$ has a root of multiplicity 2. This is because the root of a quadratic polynomial has multiplicity 2 when the discriminant D is 0. If $g(x)-\alpha x=ax^2+(b-\alpha)x+c \implies 0 = \text{D} = (b-\alpha)^2-4ac \iff \alpha = \pm 2\sqrt{ac}+b$.

Also if $i\neq j: \alpha_i \neq \alpha_j$ the polynomials $u(t)-t\alpha_i$ and $u(t)-t\alpha_j$ do not have common roots. This means that if $1 \leq i \leq 4: \alpha_i$ are all different then $v^2(t)$ has at least $6 = 2+2+1+1$ different roots. This a contradiction.

Therefore if genus is $0$ then $f$ cannot be separable. We have shown that genus of $F$ is 0 or 1, this means that for $f$ separable we must have genus 1.

Denote $w=x_2^2-f(x_1)$.
\begin{gather}
\frac{\partial w}{\partial x_1} = -f'(x_1), \frac{\partial w}{\partial x_1} = 2x_2
\end{gather}
For a singularity $\alpha = (\alpha_1, \alpha_2), \alpha_2$ must be $0$ and $\alpha_1$ must be a root of $f(x_1)$ and also of $f'(x_1)$ this is true iff $f(x_1)$ is separable. If $f(x_1)$ is not separable then it shares a common root $\alpha_1$ with $f'(x_1)$ and this gives us singularity at $(\alpha_1, 0)$. This proves the rest of the theorem.

$\qed$
